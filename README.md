# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This is the final project for Machine Learning (Supervised Learning) course, and is solving a classification problem based on "Customer Churn Prediction".

Churn is defined as a phenomenon in which a customer cancels a subscription or leave a particular brand or business i.e., they stop buying their products or services. This project will predict which customers are most likely to discontinue the association with an entity, and which are not. The information obtained from this data will be helpful for the companies as they will look to retain their customers by analyzing which customers are at a high risk of leaving.

The dataset we are using in this project is a telecom industry dataset, which consists of 100,000 rows and 100 columns. The columns are divided into 79 numerical and 21 categorical features. Some of the features the dataset is demonstrating include the customers’ number of attempted, received, unanswered, and blocked calls, customer care and roaming calls, number of months in service, number of handsets a customer has, along with other features which were evaluated in predicting ‘churn’.
